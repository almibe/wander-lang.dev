Hello, just a quick update to make sure this section of the site is working and to announce Wander 0.4.0.
This is the second release since rewriting the syntax to support currying better.
The main features are pipes work with the new syntax and a lot of fixes regarding how functions work.

My plan is to take a break from working on the language itself to get [Wander Components](https://github.com/almibe/wander-components)
and this website in good shape.
I also want to then start work on using Wander in projects more, and hopefully do some small incremental releases as I go.
