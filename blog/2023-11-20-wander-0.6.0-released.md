Hello, tonight I've release [Wander 0.6.1 to npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wander-lang/wander).
This release is the first release of Wander based on Scala.js instead of Rust w/ wasm-bindgen.
I plan on maintaining both the Rust and Scala implementations but for now the Scala.js version is my main focus.

This release also includes changes to Wander's syntax.
I've simplified things a bit and Wander is definately taking more of a scripting language focus.
The main change is that I've decided to start using commas to separate expressions.
I've also changed how `let` and `when` expressions work.

Next plans are to get wander-components working with 0.6.0 and then working on this website.
